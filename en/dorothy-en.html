            In 1903, <strong>Dorothy Levitt</strong> became the first woman to drive a racing car
            in Great Britain. An icon of speed and a symbol of female daring, she was also
            among the first to imagine the use of a rearview mirror. But like so many brilliant
            women, her name vanished from History.

          <h2>A pioneer of speed<br />and freedom</h2>

          <p>
            Born in London in 1882, Dorothy Levitt (whose real name was Dorothy Elizabeth Levi)
            rose in a world entirely dominated by men: engines, oil, and speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1905, she won the Southport Speed Trial, at a time when women still did not even
            have the right to vote.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her races made the headlines in British newspapers: she became a media icon,
            proudly carrying a steering wheel in the press and speed in real life.

          <h2>An inventor ahead<br />of her time</h2>

          <p>
            Beyond her sporting achievements, Dorothy Levitt also stood out as a teacher and innovator.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1909, she published <em>The Woman and the Car</em>, a driving guide written for women.
            In it, she suggested a revolutionary idea: using a small hand mirror to look behind.
            In other words, anticipating what would later be called… the rearview mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, cars were not equipped with such a device. It would take years for this
            invention to become standard, often without anyone ever crediting its origin.
          </p>

          <h2>A free woman, yet<br />erased by History</h2>

          <p>
            Despite her talent and media fame, Dorothy Levitt gradually disappeared from archives
            after 1910.
          </p>
          <p>
            Little information remains about her life after racing. Some sources mention health issues;
            others suggest a voluntary retreat under social pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is certain is that her achievements were erased from automotive history books,
            often attributed to male drivers.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="article-quote article-quote--small">
            “Dorothy Levitt was not only a driver. She was an engineer, a writer, a visionary.”

          <h2>Legacy<br />and rediscovery</h2>

          <p>
            Today, Dorothy Levitt is being rediscovered as a major figure in automotive
            and feminist history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Articles, exhibitions, and documentaries are gradually restoring the place she deserves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her legacy goes beyond performance: she embodies women’s conquest of autonomy
            through speed, mastery, and innovation.
